# django-personal
A personal web page created using Django &amp; Bootstrap

I made this app just to try out Django framework. I really enjoyed doing it, Django is awesome...
This was made using Python 2, so to download and run the app in your computer, python must be previously installed.

Notes on how to use the app.
1. Clone the repo
2. Using the command line, enter into ..\dj-app\mysite\
3. Run the command 'python manage.py runserver'
4. Once the server is running, open your browser and go to 'localhost:8000'
